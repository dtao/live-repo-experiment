# The Basic Idea

- 100% client-side
- Uses GitHub (or Bitbucket?) as a backend
- Looks for posts/articles/whatever in a predefined location (maybe make
  configurable via query string)
- Renders content in Markdown
- Author can edit the blog in the browser, makes API calls to update
- Simpler than Jekyll or Middleman or whatever
